    <string name="cause_helopelthis">Helopelthis sp. Pest</string>
    <string name="symptom_helopelthis">The nymphs and adults attack young and mature cocoa pods by piercing their mouthparts into the tissues and then sucking the fluid inside. While sucking the pod’s fluid, the insects release substances (containing hydrolytic and oxidoreductase enzymes) that act as toxins and can kill the tissue cells around the puncture site. Symptoms of cocoa pods attacked by Helopeltis spp. are marked by dark brown spots. Attacks on young pods cause the spots to merge, resulting in cracked pod skin. Young pods may wither and dry up, eventually falling off. If the pod continues to grow, the skin will harden and crack, and the pod’s shape will change, hindering seed development inside. In mature pods, the attack is characterized by sunken light brown spots that gradually turn black. Severe attacks on young pods cause spots to merge, leading to cracked skin and pod deformation.</string>
    <string name="seedcond_helo">Helopeltis does not directly attack cocoa seeds, but the damage inflicted on the pod impacts the seed condition inside. Pods attacked by Helopeltis do not develop properly, resulting in smaller and lighter cocoa seeds, thereby reducing their quality. In severe cases, the cocoa pods may dry out and become damaged prematurely, causing the seeds to die and become unusable.</string>
    <string name="control_helo1">Pruning to remove water shoots (wiwilan) around the main branches every 2–3 weeks can reduce the Helopeltis population because these shoots are a common egg-laying site.</string>
    <string name="control_helo2">Reducing canopy density in cocoa plantations can help decrease excess humidity that promotes the development of Helopeltis.</string>
    <string name="control_helo3">Regular harvesting minimizes the number of pods left on the trees, reducing potential breeding grounds for Helopeltis.</string>
    <string name="disease_solution_temp">Cocoa seeds from fruit infected with black pod disease are usually black, hard, and unsuitable for further processing. Infected seeds cannot be fermented and suffer structural damage, resulting in a loss of economic value.</string>

    <string name="name_blackpod">Black Pod Disease</string>
    <string name="cause_blackpod">Phytophthora palmivora Fungus</string>
    <string name="symptom_blackpod">The symptoms of black pod disease can appear in both young and mature fruits. Infected fruits rot and develop dark brown to black spots, starting at the tip or base of the fruit. This is caused by indentations at the tip or base that trap water, allowing spores to infect from those areas. Fruit decay progresses quickly, often within a few days, rendering the fruit unharvestable.</string>
    <string name="seedcond_blackpod">Cocoa fruits infected with black pod disease experience significant seed quality degradation. The interior of the fruit decays due to fungal infection, causing the seeds to either become submerged in rot-induced liquid or dry and hard. These seeds fail to develop properly, often die, turn black, and are smaller compared to normal seeds.</string>
    <string name="control_blackpod1">Sanitation involves picking rotten fruits during pruning or harvesting, then burying them 30 cm deep in the soil. During the rainy season, sanitation should be carried out weekly.</string>
    <string name="control_blackpod2">Environmental improvements include adjusting and trimming shade trees. In areas prone to waterlogging, drainage systems should be implemented to manage excess water.</string>
    <string name="control_blackpod3">Use fungicides containing copper-based active ingredients (contact) or mefenoxam (systemic) at a dosage of 3 ml/l.</string>

    <string name="strip">-</string>
    <string name="seedcond_none">The condition of healthy cocoa seeds is ensured when the fruit skin remains intact without damage, showing resistance to pests and diseases. Healthy cocoa fruits display a bright green to natural red color, depending on their variety, without discoloration caused by infections or decay.</string>
    <string name="control_none1">Garden Sanitation: Perform regular garden cleaning, remove infected fruits, and clear dead plant parts.</string>
    <string name="control_none2">Regular Pruning: Trim excess branches to improve air circulation and reduce moisture around the fruits.</string>
    <string name="control_none3">Good Drainage: Ensure the plantation area has an effective drainage system to prevent water pooling, which encourages fungal growth.</string>
    <string name="control_none4">Variety Selection: Plant cocoa varieties that are more resistant to Phytophthora attacks, such as hybrid varieties.</string>
    <string name="symptom_none">Healthy cocoa fruits are characterized by bright and consistent coloration, free from spots or signs of rot. High-quality fruits indicate rich flavor and optimal nutrition, without damage caused by pests or diseases.</string>

    <string name="dummy_news_title">Chocolate Faces Scarcity as Cocoa Prices Soar 98% in 3 Months</string>
    <string name="dummy_news_detail">The surge in cocoa prices threatens a global chocolate shortage, with economists predicting this upward trend will continue through late 2024. Key factors include extreme weather caused by El Niño, plant diseases like swollen shoot, and smuggling that suppresses production in Côte d\’Ivoire and Ghana, the world\'s primary cocoa producers. Low yields have driven up raw material costs, forcing chocolate manufacturers to adjust operations to survive the rising expenses. The impact extends to other cocoa-based products, such as cosmetics and pharmaceuticals, disrupting global supply chains.\n\nIn Indonesia, the cocoa price surge has affected local chocolate producers\' stocks, like PT Wahana Interfood Nusantara Tbk (COCO), which saw a 47% increase in March 2024. Despite the jump, COCO\'s stock price remained stagnant toward the close, reflecting market volatility amid cocoa supply uncertainty. This illustrates the significant impact of global dynamics on the local economy, especially in the chocolate industry.</string>

    <string name="cause_pod_borer">Conopomorpha Cramerella pest infestation</string>
    <string name="symptom_pod_borer">Cocoa pods that are infested generally show signs of premature ripening, characterized by greenish-yellow or yellow-orange spots. The affected cocoa pods become heavier, and when shaken, no sound is heard from the seeds knocking against the pod walls. This occurs due to the presence of slime, debris in the fruit flesh, seeds sticking to the flesh, and the damage to the seeds inside the pod. The infestation is marked by small holes or black spots on the cocoa pod\'s skin, indicating the entry points of the borer larvae.</string>
    <string name="seedcond_pod_borer">Cocoa pod borer infestation significantly affects the quality of cocoa beans. When the pod is split open, the inside reveals damaged tissue caused by the larvae\'s bites. The cocoa beans become deformed, often sticking together due to the sticky secretion from the larvae. The beans become small, underdeveloped, and often damaged by the larvae feeding on both the fruit flesh and the beans. Infested pods are often not suitable for harvesting due to the internal damage caused by the larvae.</string>
    <string name="control_pod_borer">Control Pod Borer</string>

    <string name="default_solution_all_disease">
        To address the combined threat of Blackpod, Pod Borer, and Helopeltis on cocoa plants, begin by promptly harvesting ripe pods and removing any infected or damaged fruits to prevent further spread. Blackpod, caused by fungi, produces spreading black lesions on pods. Apply copper-based fungicides like copper oxychloride regularly, especially during the rainy season. For Pod Borer and Helopeltis, both major pests, apply selective insecticides such as deltamethrin or abamectin periodically on young shoots and pods. Wrap young pods with protective plastic or recycled cement paper bags to deter egg-laying and feeding. Prune dense branches regularly to improve airflow and reduce humidity, which limits fungal growth. Set up a weekly monitoring schedule to detect early symptoms and apply timely control measures. Practice crop rotation if feasible and avoid overcrowding to increase sun exposure. An integrated approach combining chemical, physical, and cultural techniques will offer the best outcomes to reduce damage and sustain cocoa production.
    </string>

    <string name="default_prevention_all_disease">
    Preventing the major cocoa diseases and pests requires an integrated strategy:&#10;Blackpod: Use cocoa varieties resistant to Phytophthora fungi such as MCC02 or Sulawesi 1. Prune trees regularly to reduce humidity and improve airflow. Maintain field sanitation by removing fallen pods and pruning infected ones. Apply copper-based fungicides preventively, particularly during the rainy season or when humidity is high.&#10;Pod Borer: This pest lays eggs by piercing the pod surface. Wrap cocoa pods at 2–3 weeks of age using transparent plastic or recycled cement paper. Install pheromone traps to monitor adult populations and determine the best timing for insecticide application. Encourage black ants (Dolichoderus thoracicus), a natural predator, to control larval populations. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm beneficial insects.&#10;Helopeltis: These sap-sucking insects cause tissue necrosis and premature fruit drop. Plant cover crops such as legumes or refugia plants to interrupt the pest\'s life cycle. Apply systemic insecticides like imidacloprid in rotation to prevent resistance buildup. Monitor the plantation regularly, especially during the dry season, and only spray when populations begin to rise. Support natural predators like spiders, ground crickets, and ants. By combining biological, chemical, and cultural methods, farmers can significantly reduce pest and disease pressure and strengthen long-term resilience of their cocoa plantations.
    </string>



    <string name="blackpod_podborer_default_solution_disease">
    Managing simultaneous attacks from Blackpod disease and Pod Borer pests on cocoa trees requires an integrated strategy. Blackpod, caused by Phytophthora fungi, commonly emerges during rainy seasons. The first step is removing infected pods and cleaning decaying plant debris from the field. Apply copper-based fungicides like copper oxychloride or copper hydroxide every two weeks during wet seasons. For Pod Borer control, wrap young pods (2–3 weeks old) with transparent plastic or recycled cement paper to block egg-laying. Install pheromone traps around the plantation to monitor adult moth populations and guide precise insecticide applications. Spray selective insecticides like emamectin benzoate or deltamethrin only when larval populations exceed the threshold, to prevent resistance buildup. Conduct regular pruning to enhance air circulation and reduce humidity, which suppresses fungal growth. Schedule weekly inspections and keep records of symptoms. By applying a balanced combination of chemical, physical, and cultural controls, damage can be minimized and cocoa yields can be maintained even in the presence of disease and pest pressures.
